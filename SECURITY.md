This document outlines the security model, assumptions, and limitations of the PVTHFHE research prototype.

## Implementation Status

- **FHE backend**: Real threshold BFV via `gnosisguild/fhe.rs`.
- **Nova IVC Proofs**: Maliciously-secure folding via nova-snark (Microsoft Nova v0.71). The IVC proof chain provides soundness guarantees through transparent verification — no Groth16 trusted ceremony required.
- **NIZK proofs**: Ajtaï D2 sigma + BFV sigma with k-round parallel repetition. Greco quotient-witness verification strengthens soundness from modular to integer-lattice level.
- **On-chain verifier**: UltraHonk verifier (Solidity) with IVC binding via `ivc_verify_result`. All IVC proof metadata (proof_hash, vk_hash, pp_hash, z0/zi commitments, verification hashes) is bound into the on-chain commitment.
- **No active surrogates on the default path** — all paths use real cryptographic proofs. The surrogate compressor is exclusively available behind `--features surrogate-compressor` (not in defaults).

## Threat Model

The PVTHFHE security model is evaluated across 6 axes:

1. **Adversary**: Malicious, computationally bounded (PPT).
2. **Corruption**: Honest-majority threshold t = ⌊n/2⌋ + 1. Up to n−t parties can be maliciously corrupted and collude.
3. **Network**: Synchronous communication for DKG and decryption rounds.
4. **Identity**: Authenticated channels; party identities are known and fixed for the duration of a protocol instance.
5. **Liveness**: Guaranteed as long as t honest parties participate.
6. **Abort**: Abort-with-public-blame; malicious behavior is detected and the offending party is identified.

## Assumptions Ledger

- **RLWE / Module-LWE**: Security of the underlying FHE scheme.
- **SIS / knLWE**: Hardness of finding short vectors, used in NIZK proofs (Ajtaï D2 commitment).
- **KZG Binding**: Security of the polynomial commitment scheme (BN254 + Grumpkin cycle).
- **Random Oracle Model**: Fiat-Shamir transform for NIZK and folding challenge derivation.

## Sigma Protocol Soundness

The ternary scalar challenge (`ch ∈ {−1,0,1}`) provides log₂(3) ≈ 1.58 bits of soundness per execution. With k-round parallel repetition (round-index binding via Fiat-Shamir), the soundness error is (2/3)^k:

| k | SIGMA_REPETITIONS | Soundness error | Effective bits | Constraint cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 2/3 (≈0.67) | ~1.58 | ~508K (baseline) |
| 10 | 10 | (2/3)^10 ≈ 0.017 | ~15.8 | ~5M |
| 45 | 45 | (2/3)^45 ≈ 2^−26 | ~71 | ~23M |
| **90** | **90** | **(2/3)^90 ≈ 2^−53** | **~142** | **~46M** (requires T4) |
| 128 | 128 | (2/3)^128 ≈ 2^−75 | ~203 | ~65M (requires T4) |

**Production target**: `SIGMA_REPETITIONS = 90` provides ~2^−53 soundness error per NIZK (≈2^−142 combined folding/SZ/NIZK budget). T4 JL random projection reduces norm-check dimensionality from 8192 to 256, keeping k=90 feasible at ~46M constraints. P1 is resolved; see `.sisyphus/plans/p1-sigma-repetition.md`.

## On-Chain Verification: IVC Binding

The `IvcBindingData` struct (11 fields: proof_hash, vk_hash, pp_hash, z0_commitment, zi_commitment, ivc_steps, share_verification_hash, decrypt_nizk_hash, dkg_transcript_hash, nova_final_state_commitment, `ivc_verify_result`) provides complete IVC proof binding for on-chain verification. The RecursiveSNARK verification outcome (`ivc_verify_result`: 1 = passed, 0 = failed) is bound into the commitment, ensuring the verifier can detect failed proofs. The Noir `nova_state_commitment` circuit accepts all 15 public inputs and operates in dual-mode: legacy Poseidon hash preimage when `ivc_proof_hash == 0`, full binding hash otherwise.

## Known Limitations & Open Problems

### P1 (CRITICAL): Lattice NIZK Soundness

**Status**: OPEN (mitigated). Per-share RLWE NIZK knowledge soundness is conditional on Module-SIS hardness over R_{q_commit}, Cyclo Theorem 3 soundness, and SHA-256 collision resistance. The sigma protocol achieves computational ZK — fresh random masks per invocation, masked sigma transcript reveals nothing about the witness. Greco quotient-witness verification strengthens soundness from modular to integer-lattice level. P1 is mitigated via `SIGMA_REPETITIONS = 90` in production.

### P2 (HIGH): LatticeFold+ Linearity

**Status**: OPEN (documented). Cyclo LatticeFold+ over RLWE with Lemma 9 accepted as a documented protocol assumption. Soundness conditional on M-SIS hardness, Cyclo Theorem 3, and the Lemma 9 invertibility assumption. LatticeFold+ provides lattice-native folding in the current prototype.

### C5 (PK Aggregation Gap)

**Status**: OPEN. No verifiable proof that `pk_agg = Σ pk_i` for the accepted participant set. Aggregate key consistency verified by runtime assertion only.

### C2 (Encryption Correctness Gap)

**Status**: OPEN. Encryption is trusted; no verifiable proof of correct encryption against the aggregate key. Mitigated by semantic roundtrip check at the aggregate level.

### C7 (Final Aggregation Gap)

**Status**: RESOLVED. In-circuit Poseidon R1CS Merkle verification via `C7MerkleStepCircuit` at depth-5 (N=8192) with real Poseidon hashing (~900 constraints per hash8). Noir aggregator_final circuit provides standalone verification.

## Trust Boundary: In-Circuit vs Native

Only the Noir `aggregator_final` circuit is verified on-chain (via HonkVerifier.sol). All other protocol proofs run natively and are NOT verifiable by the on-chain verifier directly. The `ivc_verify_result` field bridges this gap by binding the Nova IVC verification outcome.

| Protocol Proof | In-Circuit | Native-Only |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Threshold/Lagrange recombination | ✓ | — |
| Plaintext derivation | ✓ | — |
| BFV encryption sigma | — | ✓ |
| PVSS DKG NIZK | — | ✓ |
| Cyclo NIZK (lattice fold) | — | ✓ |
| Nova IVC fold soundness | — | ✓ (bound via `ivc_verify_result`) |
| C7 decryption aggregation | ✓ (Poseidon R1CS) | — |

## Post-Quantum Proving Stack

Post-quantum proving stack: LaZer (sigma) → Greyhound (commitments) → LatticeFold+ (folding) → UltraHonk (final proof).

## G7b Norm Enforcement

`CycloFoldStepCircuit` with state_len=8 tracks z_s_sq_acc/z_e_sq_acc accumulators to enforce norm bounds across fold steps. Defense-in-depth against unbounded norm growth.

## Parity-Check Proofs

RS polynomial verification with O(1) per-recipient DKG verification cost. Single parity proof replaces n separate NIZK proofs per party.

## Logging Hygiene

All FHE plaintext-slot logging is gated behind `trace-decrypt` feature, **disabled by default**. Must never be enabled in production, benchmarks with real plaintext, or any environment where plaintext confidentiality is required.

## Smudging

Conservative smudging parameter: σ_smudge = 2⁴⁰ · σ_err, providing >100 bits of statistical security against noise-based leakage (validated for N=8192). Two modes: `legacy_local_smudge` (local fresh Gaussian, non-committed) and `committed_smudge_pvss` (DKG-committed e_sm polynomial, the target committed mode with on-chain freshness enforcement via SessionRegistry).
